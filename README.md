# BSGatlas workflow

These are the scripts that were used to create the [BSGatlas](https://rth.dk/resources/bsgatlas/)
annotation for *Bacillus subtilis* strain 168.

**BSGatlas: An enhanced annotation integration of the Bacillus subtilis genome **  
Geissler AS, Anthon C, GonzÃ¡lez-Tortuero E, Poulsen LD, Kallehauge TK, Seemann SE, Vinther J, Gorodkin J . Under review 

The folder structure in this project is:

* `analysis`: R scripts that created the annotation and associated analyses
* `data-raw`: Utilized external data in their raw form
* `data`: Parsed form of the external data. Contains both scripts and Rdata objects 
* `data-hub`: Browser hub folder for the final BSGatlas annotation
* `data-gff`: GFF version of the BSGatlas
* `scripts`:  longer scripts and helper functions that were used


For improved reproducbility, an exact description of the used conda environment
is stored in `conda.yml` with

    conda env export > conda.yml

If you wish to recreate this environment, install it and activate it with

    conda env create --file cona.yml
    conda activate bsgatlas
