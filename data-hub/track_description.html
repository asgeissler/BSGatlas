      <B>Genes:</B> Results after merging various gene annotation resources.
      A click on individual gene shows all meta information related to it
      from the used resources.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      <B>Transcriptional Units (TU):</B> The resources
      DBTBS, SubtiWiki, and BsubCyc provide transcriptional units. The collection
      of these are shown in this track. A click on an individual TU reveals
      which of these resources annotate it.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      <B>Operon:</B> TUs that share at least one gene steam from the same operon.
      The here shown operons were computed from the list of TUs by following
      this rule.

      <B>Unmerged Genes:</B> 
      Composite track that contains all resources that were used in the during
      gene merging. The track controls allows the selection of each resource
      and shows the priority level that were assigned to it.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      <B>Sensetive Rfam:</B> 
      A scan of the Bacillus genome at sensetive levels provided
      additional predictions for Rfam 14.1 families.
      We deemed as to sensetive, and were not explicitly included,
      however, we show them here.

  <H2>External Transcription start/termination resources</H2><BR/>
  The resources shown below provide sets of positions of
  transcription start and termination sites, as well as binding
  sites of transcriptional factors and untranslated regions (UTRs) as annotated
  in each resources.
  Each resource is represented by a composite track, which allows selection
  by annotation type.
