   <td style="text-align:left;"> YvcJ is a P-loop-containing protein with ATPase and GTPase activity that is able to phosphorylate an unidentified cellular component |CITS: [19074378]|.  Growth conditions influence both the phosphorylation event and the cellular localization of YvcJ |CITS: [21709426]|.

<i>yvcJ</i> mutants have decreased transformation efficiency and a reduced fraction of cells that express competence |CITS: [19074378]|.  A mutation in the active site K22 residue, which is necessary for its GTPase activity, also leads to a decrease in competence efficiency |CITS: [21709426]|.

One or more strains containing mutant alleles of this gene can be obtained from the <b>Bacillus Genetic Stock Center</b>.  Click <a href="http://pasture.asc.ohio-state.edu/BGSC/index.cfm?Search=yvcJ&amp;Go=Search">here</a> to see the list of available strains at BGSC. </td>

The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>
