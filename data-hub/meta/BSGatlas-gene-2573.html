After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (LBGstat) Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (Sigma) supplemented with glucose 0.3 % [LBG] at 37°C with  vigorous shaking in flasks. Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in fresh pre-warmed medium and samples were collected during the exponential [exp], transition  [tran] and  stationary [stat] phases of the growth cycle . </td>

At OD540 of 0.3, the culture were divided into four subcultures and diamide 0.6 mM [Diami], paraquat 0.4 mM [Paraq], H2O2 0.1mM [H2O2] or no oxidative drug [Oxctl] were added to the medium. Samples were taken 10 minutes after addition </td>
