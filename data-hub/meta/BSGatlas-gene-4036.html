In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (LBGstat) Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (Sigma) supplemented with glucose 0.3 % [LBG] at 37°C with  vigorous shaking in flasks. Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in fresh pre-warmed medium and samples were collected during the exponential [exp], transition  [tran] and  stationary [stat] phases of the growth cycle . </td>
