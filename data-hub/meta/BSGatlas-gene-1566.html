Hecker, J Gen Microbiol 139, 2041, Sep, 1993) with 0.2 % glucose as carbon source (Belitsky Minimal Medium/BMM) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Stress was applied to exponentially growing cultures at OD500nm of 0.4. Samples were harvested before stress [BMM]; after a rapid temperature up-shift from 37 °C to 48 °C [Heat]; after a temperature down-shift from 37 °C to 18 °C [Cold]. Ethanol stress was imposed by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 4 % (v/v) and cells were harvested 10 minutes after ethanol addition [Etha]. </td>

After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

Purified spores were heat activated at 70°C  in Tris 10 mM pH8.4 and germination was initiated by the addition of L-alanine 10 mM (A. Moir, J Bacteriol 146, 1106, Jun, 1981). After incubation for one hour at 37°C, the culture was diluted with an equal volume of 2X LBmedium and germinating cells were harvested at 135, 150 or 180 minutes after addition of L-alanine [G135, G150 and G180]. </td>
