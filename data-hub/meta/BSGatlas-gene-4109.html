For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

For growth at high or low temperatures, pre-cultures were grown at 37 °C, diluted to an OD578nm of 0.1 and subsequently transferred to 51 °C [HiTm] and 16 °C [LoTm], respectively.

After a few hours growth at 37°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S].
