After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

Cells from the control cultures were harvested after 24 hours of incubation [BT]. Biofilms were harvested from 96 well plates after incubation for 36 hours [B36] and 60 hours [B60]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (BC) Cultures were inoculated from frozen glycerol stocks and grown overnight in LB at 37°C.  These cultures were thendiluted, plated onto LB plates, and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested  from plates containing individual colonies [BI] andfrom plates with confluen growth [BC]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (Etha) Cells were grown in a synthetic medium (J. Stülke, R. Hanschke, M. Hecker, J Gen Microbiol 139, 2041, Sep, 1993) with 0.2 % glucose as carbon source (Belitsky Minimal Medium/BMM) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Stress was applied to exponentially growing cultures at OD500nm of 0.4. Samples were harvested before stress [BMM]; after a rapid temperature up-shift from 37 °C to 48 °C [Heat]; after a temperature down-shift from 37 °C to 18 °C [Cold]. Ethanol stress was imposed by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 4 % (v/v) and cells were harvested 10 minutes after ethanol addition [Etha]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (LoTm) Cells were grown in Spizizen’s minimal medium (SMM) (C. Anagnostopoulos, J. Spizizen, J Bacteriol 81, 741, May, 1961) with vigorous agitation. The control culture was grown at 37 °C [SMMPr]. For growth at high or low temperatures, pre-cultures were grown at 37 °C, diluted to an OD578nm of 0.1 and subsequently transferred to 51 °C [HiTm] and 16 °C [LoTm], respectively. For the growth at high salinity, the salinity of the medium was adjusted by adding NaCl (5 M stock solution) to produce a final concentration of 1.2 M [HiOs]. </td>
