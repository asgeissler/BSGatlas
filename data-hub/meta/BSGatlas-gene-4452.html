   <td style="text-align:left;"> |FRAME: BSU38290-MONOMER "Thiamine-phosphate diphosphorylase"| (ThiE) catalyzes an important step in the <i>de novo</i> pathway of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| biosynthesis, the coupling of the two moieties of thiamin, a thiazole (|FRAME: CPD-13576|) and a pyrimidine (|FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|), forming |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| |CITS: [JAMCHEMSOC1172351]|.

In addition, the enzyme may catalyze a similar reaction in a slavage pathway, where it couples |FRAME: THZ-P| to the pyrimidine moiety.

While most of the research on ThiE was performed with the E. coli enzyme, a genetic screen designed to identify |FRAME: TAX-1423| genes that participate in thiamin metabolism identifed the |FRAME: BSU38290| gene |CITS: [15292217]|. The crystal structure of the |FRAME: TAX-1423| enzyme complexed with the reaction products thiamin phosphate and diphosphate has been determined |CITS: [10350464]|. The structure and other mechanistic studies are consistent with a reaction mechanism involving the ionization of |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| at the active site to give the pyrimidine carbocation. The reaction is completed by trapping of the carbocation by the thiazole followed by product dissociation |CITS: [10350464]|. </td>
