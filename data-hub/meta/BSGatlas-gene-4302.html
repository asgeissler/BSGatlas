   <td style="text-align:left;"> (GM+45) A culture of LB medium was inocualted from a frozen glycerol stock of B. subtilis. After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (MG+t5) A culture of LB medium was inocualted from a frozen glycerol stock of B. subtilis. After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

These cultures were thendiluted, plated onto LB plates, and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested  from plates containing individual colonies [BI] andfrom plates with confluen growth [BC]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (M9stat) Cells were grown in M9 supplemented with glucose (0.3 %) at 37°C with vigorous shaking. The composition of the M9 minimal medium is (per liter): 8.5 g Na2HPO4.2H20, 3 g KH2PO4, 1 g NH4Cl and 0.5 g NaCl.  The following solutions were individually sterilized and added (volumes per liter of medium): 1 ml 0.1 M CaCl2.2H2O, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4.7H2O, 1 ml 50 mM Fe-Citrate.  Also added was 10 ml of a trace salts solution containing (per liter): 170 mg ZnCl2, 100 mg MnCl2.4H2O, 60 mg CoCl2.6H2O, 60 mg Na2MoO4.2H2O and 43 mg CuCl2.2H2O.  Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in pre-warmed M9 medium and samples were harvested during exponential growth [M9exp], at the transition phase [M9tran] and during stationary phase [M9stat]. </td>
