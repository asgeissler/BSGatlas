   <td style="text-align:left;"> (Glu) A  5 ml aliquot of LB medium was inoculated using frozen culture stocks. After a few hours growth at 37°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S]. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH neutralized with 4 M NaOH prior to addition to the medium. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
