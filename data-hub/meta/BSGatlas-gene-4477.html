   <td style="text-align:left;"> <b>General Background</b>

Wall teichoic acids, as well as type I and IV lipoteichoic acids, are modified with |FRAME: D-ALANINE| residues, and the enzymes required for this process are encoded by the <i>dltABCD</i> operon |CITS: [1385594]|.

The process starts in the cytoplasm, where |FRAME: EC-6.2.1.M5| (DltA) activates |FRAME: D-ALANINE| using ATP to form a high-energy |FRAME: CPD-19306| intermediate and subsequently transfers it to the phosphopantheinyl prosthetic group of the |FRAME: D-alanine-carrier-protein| (DltC) |CITS: [18847223][18784082][19324056]|.

The product of the DltD gene contains a single putative N-terminal transmembrane helix and a large globular domain. While the exact activity of the enzyme is still not well understood, the gene was cloned and sequenced from |FRAME: TAX-1582|, and a mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis. The mutant lost the ability to incorporate D-alanine into lipoteichoic acids, a defect that could be complemented by the expression of an intact version of the gene |CITS: [10781555]|.

The protein was shown to bind to DltC and to possess a thioesterase activity, and thus it was suggested that it may catalyze the final D-alanyl transfer from DltC to teichoic acid. However this could not be demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [10781555]|.

The discovery of substantial amounts of |FRAME: 1-Phosphatidyl-2-O-D-Ala-Glycerol| in lipid lysate from |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [26998233]| has led to a new hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, DltD may catalyze the transfer of DltC-bound D-alanyl group to |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol| in the bacterial membrane by a thermodynamically spontaneous esterification reaction. |FRAME: 1-Phosphatidyl-2-O-D-Ala-Glycerol| in turn may serve as the lipid intermediate for subsequent D-alanylation of teichoic acids, catalyzed by DltB |CITS: [27134729]|.

<b>About This enzyme</b>

The <i>dlt</i> operon of |FRAME: TAX-224308| was discovered based on its similarity to the genes from |FRAME: TAX-1582| |CITS: [7797557]|. Each of the four genes was inactivated, and analysis of the mutants confirmed that they lacked |FRAME: D-ALANINE| in both their lipoteichoic acids and their wall teichoic acids |CITS: [7797557]|.

The |FRAME: BSU38500| and |FRAME: BSU38520| genes of |FRAME: TAX-224308| were cloned with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag and expressed in |FRAME: TAX-562|, and the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity |CITS: [15955059]|. The <i>apo</i> DltC protein was efficiently modified to a <i>holo</i> form by both AcpS (the PPTase of primary metabolism) and Sfp (the PPTase of secondary metabolism).  The purified DltA protein activated only |FRAME: D-ALANINE|, and was rather specific for the D-alanyl-carrier protein (it has some activity with the fatty acid ACP, but the Km for that substrate is in the mM range) |CITS: [15955059]|.

A crystal structure at 2.0 Å resolution has been reported for the DltA protein from |FRAME: TAX-1396| in complex with the |FRAME: CPD-19306| intermediate |CITS: [18847223]|. </td>

Also added was 10 ml of a trace salts solution containing (per liter): 170 mg ZnCl2, 100 mg MnCl2.4H2O, 60 mg CoCl2.6H2O, 60 mg Na2MoO4.2H2O and 43 mg CuCl2.2H2O.  Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in pre-warmed M9 medium and samples were harvested during exponential growth [M9exp], at the transition phase [M9tran] and during stationary phase [M9stat]. </td>

Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
