   <td style="text-align:left;"> YabT is a Hanks-type protein kinase whose activity is dependent on DNA binding; it phosphoryates Ser2 of the RecA protein.  YabT is expressed during sporulation and localizes to the spore septum.  A <i>yabT</i> mutant sporulates more slowly than wild type and shows reduced resistance to DNA damage |CITS: [23634894]|.

After a few hours growth at 37°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S]. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH neutralized with 4 M NaOH prior to addition to the medium. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (M40t90) Cells were grown in LB medium at 37°C with vigorous shaking.  An exponentially growing culture (O.D.600 approx. 0.25) was divided: one culture acted as the control [no mitomycin C , M0] while mitomycin was added to the second culture to a final concentration of 40 ng/ml [mitomycin, M40].  Samples were harvested at 0, 45 and 90 minutes after mitomycin addition [t0, t45 and t90]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S1) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>

Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
