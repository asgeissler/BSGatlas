   <td style="text-align:left;"> <i>B. subtilis</i> contains two genes encoding glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase enzymes, <i>nagB</i> and <i>gamA</i>.  Only deletion of <i>gamA</i> significantly affects the ability of <i>B. subtilis</i> to grow on glucosamine or <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine as the sole source of carbon |CITS: [23667565]|.

Unlike the <i>E. coli</i> enzyme, <i>B. subtilis</i> NagB is monomeric and not allosterically regulated |CITS: [15755726]|.

A crystal structure of NagB has been solved at 1.5 Ã… resolution |CITS: [15755726]|.

After a few hours growth at 37Â°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S8) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37Â°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
