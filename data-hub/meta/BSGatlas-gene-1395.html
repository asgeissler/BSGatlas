For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.

Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

Samples were harvested before stress [BMM]; after a rapid temperature up-shift from 37 °C to 48 °C [Heat]; after a temperature down-shift from 37 °C to 18 °C [Cold]. Ethanol stress was imposed by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 4 % (v/v) and cells were harvested 10 minutes after ethanol addition [Etha]. </td>
