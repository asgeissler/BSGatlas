   <td style="text-align:left;"> The |FRAME: BSU35760| gene of |FRAME:TAX-224308| was proposed to catalyze a priming reaction, attaching the first
glycerol phosphate unit to the disccharide of the teichoic acid linkage unit. This attachment is required before the |FRAME: BSU35720 TagF| polymerase can add successive glycerol phosphate units to the nascent chain. TagB has a strong sequence similarity to TagF, which has been confirmed to catalyze the polymerization reaction |CITS: [12637499]|, supports this hypothesis |CITS: [11882717]|.

The |FRAME: BSU35760| gene was cloned with a poly-His tag and expressed in |FRAME: TAX-562|, and the recombinant protein was purified |CITS: [17163636]|. A substrate for the enzyme was prepared by incubating purified |FRAME: BSU35750 TagA| enzyme with a synthetic substrate that contains a synthetic 13-carbon saturated lipid chain instead of the natural 55-carbon undecaprenyl. When purified TagB protein was incubated with this substrate and CDP-glycerol, it produced the expected prduct, which was confirmed by NMR |CITS: [17163636]|. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S6) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (T0.30H) Anon-sporulating B. subtilis strain was grown in a modified M9 medium in batch culture (T. Hardiman, K. Lemuth, M. A. Keller, M. Reuss, M. Siemann-Herzberg, J Biotechnol 132, 359, Dec 1, 2007). Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
