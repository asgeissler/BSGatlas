Also added was 10 ml of a trace salts solution containing (per liter): 170 mg ZnCl2, 100 mg MnCl2.4H2O, 60 mg CoCl2.6H2O, 60 mg Na2MoO4.2H2O and 43 mg CuCl2.2H2O.  Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in pre-warmed M9 medium and samples were harvested during exponential growth [M9exp], at the transition phase [M9tran] and during stationary phase [M9stat]. </td>
