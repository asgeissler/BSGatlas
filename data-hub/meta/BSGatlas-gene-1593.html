Davidoff-Abelson, J Mol Biol 56, 209, Mar 14, 1971). After growth at 37°C with vigorous shaking, cells were diluted ten times in fresh pre-warmed minimal medium and samples were harvested after  a period of 30 minutes [C30] , i.e. before maximal induction of competence, and after a period of 90 minutes [C90], i.e. when competence induction was maximal. </td>

Stress was applied to exponentially growing cultures at OD500nm of 0.4. Samples were harvested before stress [BMM]; after a rapid temperature up-shift from 37 °C to 48 °C [Heat]; after a temperature down-shift from 37 °C to 18 °C [Cold]. Ethanol stress was imposed by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 4 % (v/v) and cells were harvested 10 minutes after ethanol addition [Etha]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (GM-0.1) A culture of LB medium was inocualted from a frozen glycerol stock of B. subtilis. After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (BC) Cultures were inoculated from frozen glycerol stocks and grown overnight in LB at 37°C.  These cultures were thendiluted, plated onto LB plates, and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested  from plates containing individual colonies [BI] andfrom plates with confluen growth [BC]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (BT) A fresh colony grown on an LB plate was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB and grown for 10 hoursat 30°C. This culture wasused to inoculate 10 ml of MSgg medium (S.S. Branda et al., J Bacteriol 186, 3970, Jun, 2004) and incubated with vigorous shaking. The cultures in MSgg were diluted to the same extent in 96 wells microtiterplates (5 μl for 1.5 ml of medium) and incubated without shaking at 30°C. Cells from the control cultures were harvested after 24 hours of incubation [BT]. Biofilms were harvested from 96 well plates after incubation for 36 hours [B36] and 60 hours [B60]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (G135) Purified spores were obtained by growing cells in DSM medium (P. Schaeffer, J. Millet, J. P. Aubert, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 54, 704, Sep, 1965) at 37°C for 48 hours after which they were washed ten times in ice cold distilled waterover a period of 5 days. Purified spores were heat activated at 70°C  in Tris 10 mM pH8.4 and germination was initiated by the addition of L-alanine 10 mM (A. Moir, J Bacteriol 146, 1106, Jun, 1981). After incubation for one hour at 37°C, the culture was diluted with an equal volume of 2X LBmedium and germinating cells were harvested at 135, 150 or 180 minutes after addition of L-alanine [G135, G150 and G180]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (HiOs) Cells were grown in Spizizen’s minimal medium (SMM) (C. Anagnostopoulos, J. Spizizen, J Bacteriol 81, 741, May, 1961) with vigorous agitation. The control culture was grown at 37 °C [SMMPr]. For growth at high or low temperatures, pre-cultures were grown at 37 °C, diluted to an OD578nm of 0.1 and subsequently transferred to 51 °C [HiTm] and 16 °C [LoTm], respectively. For the growth at high salinity, the salinity of the medium was adjusted by adding NaCl (5 M stock solution) to produce a final concentration of 1.2 M [HiOs]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S7) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>

Siemann-Herzberg, J Biotechnol 132, 359, Dec 1, 2007). Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
