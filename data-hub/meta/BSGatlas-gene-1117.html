   <td style="text-align:left;"> YhcS is a sortase that anchors target proteins to the cell wall |CITS: [21800427][21906378]|.

Sorting of YhcR and YfkN to the cell surface depends on the presence of YhcS |CITS: [21906378]|.  The sortase recognition and cell wall-anchoring motif of YhcR is functional when fused to a reporter protein that is normally secreted |CITS: [21800427][21906378]|. 

<i>yhcS</i> expression is higest during the late stationary phase |CITS: [21906378]|. </td>
