   <td style="text-align:left;"> The last reaction of the methionine salvage pathway is catalyzed in |FRAME: TAX-1423|, as in mammals, by a glutamine-dependent transaminase, encoded by the |FRAME: BSU13580| gene.
The gene is located in a region of the |FRAME: TAX-1423| genome encoding most of the enzymes involved in the methionine salvage pathway. 

While believed to be specific for methionine transamination, disruption of the gene had no visible effect on growth on |FRAME: CPD-560| as the sulfur source ( (on this medium the sulfur nutrition of the cells depends entirely on the methionine salvage pathway). This observation was explained by the redundant function of isozymes (up to nine amino acid transaminases are present in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [12022921]|. However, in a subsequent experiment, mutants were shown to grow more slowly that the wild type, and entered stationary phase at a substantially lower optical density |CITS: [24837359]|.

In a study of several amino acid transaminases from |FRAME: TAX-1423|, it was found that only MtnE (then known as YkrV) was able to convert |FRAME: CPD-479| to L-methionine, and it catalyzed the reaction only when L-glutamine was used as amino donor |CITS: [12670965]|. In that study, the <i>aspB</i>, <i>patA</i>, <i>yugH</i>, |FRAME: BSU13580|, and <i>ywfG</i> genes were cloned and functionally expressed as calmodulin-binding peptide fusion proteins and screened for L-methionine regeneration activity using a mixture containing |FRAME: CPD-479| as the amino acceptor and various amino acids as potential amino donors. </td>

The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper).

At OD540 of 0.3, the culture were divided into four subcultures and diamide 0.6 mM [Diami], paraquat 0.4 mM [Paraq], H2O2 0.1mM [H2O2] or no oxidative drug [Oxctl] were added to the medium. Samples were taken 10 minutes after addition </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S8) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
