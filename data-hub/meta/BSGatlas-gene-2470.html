After growth at 37°C with vigorous shaking, cells were diluted ten times in fresh pre-warmed minimal medium and samples were harvested after  a period of 30 minutes [C30] , i.e. before maximal induction of competence, and after a period of 90 minutes [C90], i.e. when competence induction was maximal. </td>

After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (G150) Purified spores were obtained by growing cells in DSM medium (P. Schaeffer, J. Millet, J. P. Aubert, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 54, 704, Sep, 1965) at 37°C for 48 hours after which they were washed ten times in ice cold distilled waterover a period of 5 days. Purified spores were heat activated at 70°C  in Tris 10 mM pH8.4 and germination was initiated by the addition of L-alanine 10 mM (A. Moir, J Bacteriol 146, 1106, Jun, 1981). After incubation for one hour at 37°C, the culture was diluted with an equal volume of 2X LBmedium and germinating cells were harvested at 135, 150 or 180 minutes after addition of L-alanine [G135, G150 and G180]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S3) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
