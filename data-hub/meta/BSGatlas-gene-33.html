The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02.

For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S6) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (SMMPr) Cells were grown in Spizizen’s minimal medium (SMM) (C. Anagnostopoulos, J. Spizizen, J Bacteriol 81, 741, May, 1961) with vigorous agitation. The control culture was grown at 37 °C [SMMPr]. For growth at high or low temperatures, pre-cultures were grown at 37 °C, diluted to an OD578nm of 0.1 and subsequently transferred to 51 °C [HiTm] and 16 °C [LoTm], respectively. For the growth at high salinity, the salinity of the medium was adjusted by adding NaCl (5 M stock solution) to produce a final concentration of 1.2 M [HiOs]. </td>
