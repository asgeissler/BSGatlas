   <td style="text-align:left;"> YjbH is a negative effector of |FRAME: BSU11500-MONOMER "Spx"|, a disulfide stress regulator |CITS: [17908206]|.  YjbH specifically enhances the proteolysis of Spx by the ClpXP protease |CITS: [19074380]|; this process is inhibited by the small protein YirB |CITS: [21378193]|.

Mutations in the <i>yjbIH</i> operon make cells hypersensitive to sodium nitruprusside (SNP), suggesting roles in nitrosative stress management |CITS: [17293416]|. </td>
