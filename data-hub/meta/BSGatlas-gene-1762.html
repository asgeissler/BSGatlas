   <td style="text-align:left;"> The biosynthesis of |FRAME: HEME_A| from |FRAME: Heme-b| is catalyzed in the membrane by two enzymes, |FRAME: BSU14880-MONOMER| and |FRAME: BSU14870-MONOMER|, encoded by the |FRAME: BSU14880| and |FRAME: BSU14870| genes, respectively. The genes are part of the <i>ctaBCDEF</i> locus, which encodes the biosynthesis of cytochrome c oxidase caa3 |CITS: [9829923]|.
Expression of the two genes in |FRAME: TAX-562|, which does not produce |FRAME: HEME_A| natrually (although it does produce |FRAME: HEME_O|), resulted in production of |FRAME: HEME_A| |CITS: [7968515]|.

A |FRAME: BSU14870| deletion mutant was found to lack both |FRAME: HEME_A| and |FRAME: HEME_O|, while a |FRAME: BSU14880| mutant produced |FRAME: HEME_O|, but lacked |FRAME: HEME_A| |CITS: [7968515]|. In addition to |FRAME: BSU14880|, |FRAME: TAX-1423| contains a paralogous gene now known as |FRAME: BSU12080|. This gene was shown to complement a |FRAME: BSU14880| deletion mutant with respect to heme <i>a</i> bisynthesis, indicating it encodes an active heme <i>o</i> synthase |CITS: [10675592]|.

|FRAME: BSU14880-MONOMER CtaB| and |FRAME: BSU14870-MONOMER CtaA| are known to interact with each other. It has been proposed that the two proteins form a complex and that |FRAME: HEME_O| is transferred directly from CtaB to CtaA |CITS: [15491161]|. 

Heme <i>o</i> synthase catalyzes the transfer of a farnesyl group from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP "farnesyl diphosphate"| to the 2-vinyl group on pyrrole ring A of |FRAME: PROTOHEME|. 

The |FRAME: BSU14880| gene of |FRAME: TAX-1423| was cloned with a His<sub>7</sub> tag and expressed on |FRAME: TAX-562|, and the recombinant protein was purified. The enzyme, which has eight transmembrane helices, binds substoichiometric amounts of |FRAME: Heme-b| and |FRAME: HEME_O|, which are the substrate and unreleased product, respectively. A strictly conserved His199 present at the extra-cellular side of helix 5 serves as the heme-binding site |CITS: [19204012]|. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (MG+120) A culture of LB medium was inocualted from a frozen glycerol stock of B. subtilis. After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (T0.0H) Anon-sporulating B. subtilis strain was grown in a modified M9 medium in batch culture (T. Hardiman, K. Lemuth, M. A. Keller, M. Reuss, M. Siemann-Herzberg, J Biotechnol 132, 359, Dec 1, 2007). Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
