For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

Purified spores were heat activated at 70°C  in Tris 10 mM pH8.4 and germination was initiated by the addition of L-alanine 10 mM (A. Moir, J Bacteriol 146, 1106, Jun, 1981). After incubation for one hour at 37°C, the culture was diluted with an equal volume of 2X LBmedium and germinating cells were harvested at 135, 150 or 180 minutes after addition of L-alanine [G135, G150 and G180]. </td>
