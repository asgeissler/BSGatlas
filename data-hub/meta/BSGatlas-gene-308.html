After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S5) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (T5.0H) Anon-sporulating B. subtilis strain was grown in a modified M9 medium in batch culture (T. Hardiman, K. Lemuth, M. A. Keller, M. Reuss, M. Siemann-Herzberg, J Biotechnol 132, 359, Dec 1, 2007). Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
