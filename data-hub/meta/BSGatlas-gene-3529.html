   <td style="text-align:left;"> BioI is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes C-C bond cleavage of |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| to generate |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs|, a crucial intermediate for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: BIOTIN|.  The enzyme can accept a range of acyl-[acp]s, with a preference for |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl-[acp]| |CITS: [11368323]|.  The proposed mechanism involves four sub-reactions, during which two oxygen atoms are incorporated at position 7 and 8 of the acyl-[acp] molecule, followed by cleavage and incorporation of a third oxygen atom to form |FRAME: 7-Oxoheptanoyl-ACPs "7-oxoheptanoyl-[acp]"|, and its subsequent oxidation to |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs "pimeloyl-[acp]"| (it is still not clear whether the last reaction is spontaneous or catalyzed by the enzyme).  The mechanism is similar to that of |FRAME: 1.14.15.6-RXN "EC 1.14.15.6, cholesterol monooxygenase (side-chain-cleaving)"| |CITS: [20658980]|.

The <i>bioI</i> gene was cloned and expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562|, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity.  The natural electron acceptor is not known, but the purified enzyme was active <i>in vitro</i> with cindoxin (a flavoprotein from |FRAME: TAX-57706|) in the presence of NADPH and |FRAME: FLAVONADPREDUCT-MONOMER "flavodoxin reductase"| from |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [11368323]|. </td>

For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

Purified spores were heat activated at 70°C  in Tris 10 mM pH8.4 and germination was initiated by the addition of L-alanine 10 mM (A. Moir, J Bacteriol 146, 1106, Jun, 1981). After incubation for one hour at 37°C, the culture was diluted with an equal volume of 2X LBmedium and germinating cells were harvested at 135, 150 or 180 minutes after addition of L-alanine [G135, G150 and G180]. </td>
