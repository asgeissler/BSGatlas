For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S]. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH neutralized with 4 M NaOH prior to addition to the medium. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S0) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (T-1.40H) Anon-sporulating B. subtilis strain was grown in a modified M9 medium in batch culture (T. Hardiman, K. Lemuth, M. A. Keller, M. Reuss, M.

Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
