   <td style="text-align:left;"> GabR regulates transcription of the <i>gabTD</i> operon in response to the availability of GABA and PLP and negatively autoregulates its own expression |CITS: [12123465][15223311]|.

Crystal structures of apo-GabR and GabR in a complex with PLP show that the protein forms a head-to-tail domain-swapped homodimer with an N-terminal winged-helix DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal type 1 aminotransferase-like domain that binds PLP |CITS: [24127574]|.  Dimerization via the C-terminal domain appears to enable DNA-binding by the N-terminal domain |CITS: [25911692]|.  The DNA binding mechanism of GabR was further investigated by SAXS, suggesting a role for the shape of the bridging sequence between the two cognate binding sites |CITS: [26681693]|.  GabR binding causes an 80Â° bend in DNA |CITS: [27640111]|.  Activation of <i>gabTD</i> transcription is likely due to a rearrangement of GabR promoter binding that is due to a conformational change when GABA forms an external aldimine with PLP in GabR |CITS: [25388514]|. </td>

After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 â 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 Â°C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

Purified spores were heat activated at 70Â°C  in Tris 10 mM pH8.4 and germination was initiated by the addition of L-alanine 10 mM (A. Moir, J Bacteriol 146, 1106, Jun, 1981). After incubation for one hour at 37Â°C, the culture was diluted with an equal volume of 2X LBmedium and germinating cells were harvested at 135, 150 or 180 minutes after addition of L-alanine [G135, G150 and G180]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (LBGstat) Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (Sigma) supplemented with glucose 0.3 % [LBG] at 37Â°C with  vigorous shaking in flasks. Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in fresh pre-warmed medium and samples were collected during the exponential [exp], transition  [tran] and  stationary [stat] phases of the growth cycle . </td>

The control culture was grown at 37 Â°C [SMMPr]. For growth at high or low temperatures, pre-cultures were grown at 37 Â°C, diluted to an OD578nm of 0.1 and subsequently transferred to 51 Â°C [HiTm] and 16 Â°C [LoTm], respectively. For the growth at high salinity, the salinity of the medium was adjusted by adding NaCl (5 M stock solution) to produce a final concentration of 1.2 M [HiOs]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (Pyr) A  5 ml aliquot of LB medium was inoculated using frozen culture stocks. After a few hours growth at 37Â°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S]. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH neutralized with 4 M NaOH prior to addition to the medium. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>
