   <td style="text-align:left;"> The cell wall of |FRAME: TAX-4577| contains a feruloylated arabinoxylan polymer known as feraxan. The polymer's backbone often contains additional side chains composed of 4-methyl-glucutonate residues, forming |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans|.

Three β-xylan xylanohydrolases capable of dissociating Zea mays ferulated arabinoxylan were purified from a |FRAME: TAX-1423| industrial enzyme preparation |CITS: [16666240]|. All three enzymes exhibited optimum activities between pH 6.5 and 7.0 and had common molecular weights of 45 kDa. The ebzymes liberated oligomeric fragments that accounted for 76% of the ferulic acid, 96% of the arabinose, 71% of the xylose, 27% of the galactose, 50% of the uronic acid, and 4% of the glucose of the feraxan |CITS: [16666240]|, and about 20% (dry weight basis) of the total maize wall preparation |CITS: [16667004]|. They did not degrade larch arabinoxylan and Rhodymenia xylan |CITS: [16666240]|.

Another study reported a |FRAME: TAX-1423| enzyme that cleaved |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylans| derived from Vigna cell walls as well as |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans glucuronoarabinoxylans| derived from maize cell walls. The enzyme recognized glucuronosyl moieties inserted as monomeric side chains along the xylan backbone, and mediated the hydrolysis of the beta-(1→4)-xylosyl linkage on the reducing side of an adjacent unsubstituted xylosyl residue, forming products containing a single glucuronosyl side chain and a single unsubstituted β 1→4Xyl pendant terminal |CITS: [1901062]|.

In a much later study, the |FRAME: BSU18150| gene of |FRAME: TAX-224308|, which encodes a glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5) protein, was cloned as an N-terminal His tag fusion, overexpressed in E. coli and purified |CITS: [17028274]|. The purified recombinant protein catalyzed the same reaction as the one described above, i.e. the exclusive cleavage of a β-1,4-xylosidic bond penultimate to that linking carbon one of the xylose residue that is substituted with α-1,2-linked 4-methyl-glucuronate. Thus the |FRAME: BSU18150| gene most likely encodes the protein characterized by |CITS: [1901062]|. </td>

These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (MG-0.2) A culture of LB medium was inocualted from a frozen glycerol stock of B. subtilis. After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S8) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
