   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although initially annotated as regulatory proteins, the |FRAME: BSU35840|, |FRAME: BSU35650| and |FRAME: BSU35520| genes encode phosphotransferases that catalyze the final step in the assembly of anionic cell wall polymers - the transferring of teichoic acids and acidic capsular polysaccharides from their lipid-linked precursors to cell wall peptidoglycan |CITS: [21964069]|.

All three gene are located within a 50 kpb segment of the chromosome that contains all of the known all teichoic acid biosynthesis genes. The three proteins belong to a protein family named LCP (LytR-Cps2A-Psr) whose members are found in all Gram-positive bacteria that produce anionic polymers. Since the three proteins have overlapping activities, a mutation in only one of them does not result in a phenotype. However, a <i>ΔtagTV</i> double mutant grows more slowly than the wild type and has a wider cell shape, and a <i>ΔtagTUV</i> triple mutant is lethal. When the |FRAME: BSU35520| gene was placed under control of an IPTG-dependent promoter in a <i>ΔtagTU</i> double mutant, removing IPTG from the medium resulted in gradual growth arrest, accompanied by cell morphology changes - the cells became shorter and wider with noticeable bulging, and eventually became almost round |CITS: [21964069]|.

Crystalization of a related protein from |FRAME: TAX-1313| (|FRAME: G-44730 Cps2A|), expressed without its transmembrane domain in |FRAME: TAX-562|, revealed that the protein was purified with an isopernoid phosphate lipid in its hydrophobic pocket. The enzyme behaved as a phosphotransferase, catalyzing the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent hydrolysis of the diphosphate phosphoester bond and releasing orthophosphate |CITS: [21964069]|.

While purified TagT expressed without its transmembrane domain does not contain a lipid, it is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of the diphosphate phosphoester bond in an exogenously provided |FRAME: GERANYL-PP| indicating that it too is a phosphotransferase.

Based on all of these observation, it has been [roposed that the three proteins are the long-sought enzymes that catalyze the final step in wall teichoic acid biosynthesis - the transfer of the acids from their lipid anchor to the peptidoglycan |CITS: [21964069]|. </td>

After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
