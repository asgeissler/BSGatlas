   <td style="text-align:left;"> PbuE likely acts as an efflux pump that lowers the purine base pool |CITS: [12923093][15629952]|.

Expression of <i>pbuE</i> is regulated by an adenine-sensing riboswitch |CITS: [14718920][16201765][16931335][20022916][21283784][23087247]|.
The riboswitch may be cleaved by RNase P <i>in vivo</i>; cleavage may lead to the stabilization of <i>pbuE</i> mRNA under normal conditions |CITS: [18441052]|. </td>

After a few hours growth at 37Â°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (T-2.40H) Anon-sporulating B. subtilis strain was grown in a modified M9 medium in batch culture (T. Hardiman, K. Lemuth, M. A. Keller, M. Reuss, M. Siemann-Herzberg, J Biotechnol 132, 359, Dec 1, 2007). Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
