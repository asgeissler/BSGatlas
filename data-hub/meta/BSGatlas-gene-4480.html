   <td style="text-align:left;"> <b>General Background</b>

Wall teichoic acids, as well as type I and IV lipoteichoic acids, are modified with |FRAME: D-ALANINE| residues, and the enzymes required for this process are encoded by the <i>dltABCD</i> operon |CITS: [1385594]|.

The process starts in the cytoplasm, where |FRAME: EC-6.2.1.M5| (DltA) activates |FRAME: D-ALANINE| using ATP to form a high-energy |FRAME: CPD-19306| intermediate and subsequently transfers it to the phosphopantheinyl prosthetic group of the |FRAME: D-alanine-carrier-protein| (DltC) |CITS: [18847223][18784082][19324056]|.

The product of the DltD gene contains a single putative N-terminal transmembrane helix and a large globular domain. While the exact activity of the enzyme is still not well understood, the gene was cloned and sequenced from |FRAME: TAX-1582|, and a mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis. The mutant lost the ability to incorporate D-alanine into lipoteichoic acids, a defect that could be complemented by the expression of an intact version of the gene |CITS: [10781555]|.

The protein was shown to bind to DltC and to possess a thioesterase activity, and thus it was suggested that it may catalyze the final D-alanyl transfer from DltC to teichoic acid. However this could not be demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [10781555]|.

The discovery of substantial amounts of |FRAME: 1-Phosphatidyl-2-O-D-Ala-Glycerol| in lipid lysate from |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [26998233]| has led to a new hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, DltD may catalyze the transfer of DltC-bound D-alanyl group to |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol| in the bacterial membrane by a thermodynamically spontaneous esterification reaction. |FRAME: 1-Phosphatidyl-2-O-D-Ala-Glycerol| in turn may serve as the lipid intermediate for subsequent D-alanylation of teichoic acids, catalyzed by DltB |CITS: [27134729]|.

<b>About This enzyme</b>

The <i>dlt</i> operon of |FRAME: TAX-224308| was discovered based on its similarity to the genes from |FRAME: TAX-1582| |CITS: [7797557]|. Each of the four genes was inactivated, and analysis of the mutants confirmed that they lacked |FRAME: D-ALANINE| in both their lipoteichoic acids and their wall teichoic acids |CITS: [7797557]|. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (T5.0H) Anon-sporulating B. subtilis strain was grown in a modified M9 medium in batch culture (T. Hardiman, K. Lemuth, M. A. Keller, M. Reuss, M. Siemann-Herzberg, J Biotechnol 132, 359, Dec 1, 2007). Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
