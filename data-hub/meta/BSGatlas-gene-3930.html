   <td style="text-align:left;"> <i>B. subtilis</i> is able to grow using |FRAME: CPD-8050| as its sole carbon source. In order to identify the enzyme(s) that operate on this compound, the genome was analyzed for genes paralogous to |FRAME: BSU39700|, which encodes |FRAME: CPLX-8649|.
Seven such genes were identified, and two of them were prominently expressed when the cells were grown on medium containing |FRAME: CPD-8050|. The two genes, |FRAME: BSU33530| and |FRAME: BSU10850|, were cloned in |FRAME:TAX-562| as C-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged fusion proteins, and the recombinant proteins were purified |CITS: [20133360]|.

Both proteins were shown to encode a functional |FRAME: CPD-8050| dehydrogenase enzyme. |FRAME: BSU10850| encodes a catabolic NAD+-dependent enzyme, while |FRAME: BSU33530| encodes a presumably biosynthetic NADP+-dependent enzyme |CITS: [20133360]|. Both enzymes possess a much reduced activity with |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|.

Inactivation of |FRAME: BSU10850|, but not |FRAME: BSU33530|, abolished growth on |FRAME: CPD-8050| |CITS: [20133360]|. </td>

Glucose was exhausted when the culture reached an OD600 of approx. 10 and this was designated T0 [T0.0H]. 7 samples were harvested at various times before glucose exhaustion [T-5.40H to T-0.40H] and 10 samples at various times after glucose exhaustion [T0.30H to T5.0H]. </td>
