After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (nit) Cells were grown in a synthetic medium (E. Härtig, A. Hartmann, M. Schätzle, A. M. Albertini, D. Jahn, Appl Environ Microbiol 72, 5260, 2006) at 37 °C. For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S2) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
