The cultures in MSgg were diluted to the same extent in 96 wells microtiterplates (5 μl for 1.5 ml of medium) and incubated without shaking at 30°C. Cells from the control cultures were harvested after 24 hours of incubation [BT]. Biofilms were harvested from 96 well plates after incubation for 36 hours [B36] and 60 hours [B60]. </td>

For growth at high or low temperatures, pre-cultures were grown at 37 °C, diluted to an OD578nm of 0.1 and subsequently transferred to 51 °C [HiTm] and 16 °C [LoTm], respectively. For the growth at high salinity, the salinity of the medium was adjusted by adding NaCl (5 M stock solution) to produce a final concentration of 1.2 M [HiOs]. </td>
