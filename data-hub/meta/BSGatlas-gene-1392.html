   <td style="text-align:left;"> Thiazole synthase (ThiG) catalyzes a very complex reaction that produces the thiazole moiety of thiamin diphosphate.
The enzyme requires three inputs - |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DXP), |FRAME: CPD-12279|, and |FRAME: Adenylated-ThiS-Proteins| |CITS: [14567704]|. 

Based on current understanding, the reaction starts when DXP binds to lysine 96 of the thiazole synthase, forming an imine that tautomerizes to aminoketone |CITS: [15012138]|. Addition of the ThiS-thiocarboxylate, (formed separately by reactions catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU11700 ThiF| and |FRAME: BSU29590 IscS|) is followed by an S/O acyl shift and loss of water, where the ThiS-thiocarboxylate sulfur is exchanged with an oxygen from DXP |CITS: [15489164]|.
In the next step the ThiS protein leaves the complex and |FRAME: CPD-12279| (formed by |FRAME: CPLX-8352 ThiO| from |FRAME: GLY|) is added. At this point a cyclization occurs via a transimination that involves the release of ThiG, producing the final product of the enzyme, |FRAME: CPD-13575| |CITS: [19216519]|. </td>

In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose).

For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.

Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture.

This culture wasused to inoculate 10 ml of MSgg medium (S.S. Branda et al., J Bacteriol 186, 3970, Jun, 2004) and incubated with vigorous shaking. The cultures in MSgg were diluted to the same extent in 96 wells microtiterplates (5 μl for 1.5 ml of medium) and incubated without shaking at 30°C. Cells from the control cultures were harvested after 24 hours of incubation [BT]. Biofilms were harvested from 96 well plates after incubation for 36 hours [B36] and 60 hours [B60]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (C90) Cellsgrown overnight on LB agar plates at 30°Cwere harvested and used to inoculate pre-warmed minimal medium at OD600 of 0.5 (D. Dubnau, R. Davidoff-Abelson, J Mol Biol 56, 209, Mar 14, 1971). After growth at 37°C with vigorous shaking, cells were diluted ten times in fresh pre-warmed minimal medium and samples were harvested after  a period of 30 minutes [C30] , i.e. before maximal induction of competence, and after a period of 90 minutes [C90], i.e. when competence induction was maximal. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (ferm) Cells were grown in a synthetic medium (E. Härtig, A. Hartmann, M. Schätzle, A. M. Albertini, D. Jahn, Appl Environ Microbiol 72, 5260, 2006) at 37 °C. For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

An exponentially growing culture (O.D.600 approx. 0.25) was divided: one culture acted as the control [no mitomycin C , M0] while mitomycin was added to the second culture to a final concentration of 40 ng/ml [mitomycin, M40].  Samples were harvested at 0, 45 and 90 minutes after mitomycin addition [t0, t45 and t90]. </td>
