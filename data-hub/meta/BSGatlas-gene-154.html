In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (M9stat) Cells were grown in M9 supplemented with glucose (0.3 %) at 37°C with vigorous shaking. The composition of the M9 minimal medium is (per liter): 8.5 g Na2HPO4.2H20, 3 g KH2PO4, 1 g NH4Cl and 0.5 g NaCl.  The following solutions were individually sterilized and added (volumes per liter of medium): 1 ml 0.1 M CaCl2.2H2O, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4.7H2O, 1 ml 50 mM Fe-Citrate.  Also added was 10 ml of a trace salts solution containing (per liter): 170 mg ZnCl2, 100 mg MnCl2.4H2O, 60 mg CoCl2.6H2O, 60 mg Na2MoO4.2H2O and 43 mg CuCl2.2H2O.  Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in pre-warmed M9 medium and samples were harvested during exponential growth [M9exp], at the transition phase [M9tran] and during stationary phase [M9stat]. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (S5) Cells were grown in CH medium at 37°C and sporulation was induced by resuspension in warm sporulation medium as described by Sterlini and Mandelstam (J. M. Sterlini, J. Mandelstam, Biochem J 113, 29, Jun, 1969). The initiation of sporulation was designated T0, the time of resuspension.  Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
