   <td style="text-align:left;"> (Mal) A  5 ml aliquot of LB medium was inoculated using frozen culture stocks. After a few hours growth at 37°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S]. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH neutralized with 4 M NaOH prior to addition to the medium. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>
