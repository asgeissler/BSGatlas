After a few hours growth at 37°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S]. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH neutralized with 4 M NaOH prior to addition to the medium. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (GM-0.1) A culture of LB medium was inocualted from a frozen glycerol stock of B. subtilis. After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. </td>
