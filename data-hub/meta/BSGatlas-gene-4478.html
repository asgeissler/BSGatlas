   <td style="text-align:left;"> <b>General Background</b>

Wall teichoic acids, as well as type I and IV lipoteichoic acids, are modified with |FRAME: D-ALANINE| residues, and the enzymes required for this process are encoded by the <i>dltABCD</i> operon |CITS: [1385594]|.

The process starts in the cytoplasm, where |FRAME: EC-6.2.1.M5| (DltA) activates |FRAME: D-ALANINE| using ATP to form a high-energy |FRAME: CPD-19306| intermediate and subsequently transfers it to the phosphopantheinyl prosthetic group of the |FRAME: D-alanine-carrier-protein| (DltC) |CITS: [18847223][18784082][19324056]|.

The product of the DltD gene contains a single putative N-terminal transmembrane helix and a large globular domain. While the exact activity of the enzyme is still not well understood, the gene was cloned and sequenced from |FRAME: TAX-1582|, and a mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis. The mutant lost the ability to incorporate D-alanine into lipoteichoic acids, a defect that could be complemented by the expression of an intact version of the gene |CITS: [10781555]|.

The protein was shown to bind to DltC and to possess a thioesterase activity, and thus it was suggested that it may catalyze the final D-alanyl transfer from DltC to teichoic acid. However this could not be demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [10781555]|.

The discovery of substantial amounts of |FRAME: 1-Phosphatidyl-2-O-D-Ala-Glycerol| in lipid lysate from |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [26998233]| has led to a new hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, DltD may catalyze the transfer of DltC-bound D-alanyl group to |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol| in the bacterial membrane by a thermodynamically spontaneous esterification reaction. |FRAME: 1-Phosphatidyl-2-O-D-Ala-Glycerol| in turn may serve as the lipid intermediate for subsequent D-alanylation of teichoic acids, catalyzed by DltB |CITS: [27134729]|.

<b>About This enzyme</b>

The <i>dlt</i> operon of |FRAME: TAX-224308| was discovered based on its similarity to the genes from |FRAME: TAX-1582| |CITS: [7797557]|. Each of the four genes was inactivated, and analysis of the mutants confirmed that they lacked |FRAME: D-ALANINE| in both their lipoteichoic acids and their wall teichoic acids |CITS: [7797557]|. </td>

For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. </td>

Samples were harvested at hourly intervals for 6 hours [S0 to S6] for the first set of experiments and for 8 hours [S0 to S8] for a  second set of experiments. </td>
